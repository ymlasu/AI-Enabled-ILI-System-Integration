We provide the following: 
1. trained neural network models in PyTorch (Google Drive links to be uploaded soon for the weights),
2. Raspberry Pi and PS4 Controller code for DC and Stepper Motor
3. extensible classes and utility functions for the D435i camera
5. Extremum Seeking Controller code for camera image signal processing
6. Code for offline prediction based on the neural network model and the recorded data
