We provide trained neural network models in PyTorch (Google Drive links to be uploaded soon for the weights),
extensible classes and utility functions for the D435i camera, an Extremum Seeking Controller code for camera image signal processing, 
risk assessment demonstration codes based on the neural network output and robot odometry.
